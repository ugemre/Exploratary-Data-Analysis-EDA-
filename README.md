# Exploratary-Data-Analysis-EDA

In this project, we have a data set which includes TV, Radio and newspaper advertising spendings and their impacts on sales of a product. 

We have a data which consists of:
  * 200 samples, 
  * 3 attributes
  * 1 target value.

- By means of z-core test we'll detect outliers sample and we'll drop them out of our dataframe. 
- After scaling dataframe we'll visualise relationships between attributes and target value. 
- And we'll finalised EDA process by recommending appropriate Machine Learning algortihm.
